Instead of skipping it and being tired or starving a few hours later, I take it in the morning and it keeps me feeling more balanced. I noticed I am less overwhelmed when I feel good about what I eat. "

I used to wake up in the middle of the night and burp like crazy and always joke to my husband that my burping is even worse than his snoring... yeah that's pretty bad. Everything about this product is amazing - the taste, the price, the results. I'm looking forward to trying the other Flip My Life products next."

After drinking this for only a week, I already feel like I've lost 15 years of aging! I know that sounds crazy but it's true! My face feels more hydrated and smoother (less fine lines) and very soft to the touch now and I have even been forgetting to put my moisturizer on at night and haven't noticed a difference.
